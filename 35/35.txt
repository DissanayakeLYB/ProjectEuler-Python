1. check the primes
2. check whether circular primes
3. collect if true. ignore if not.

1. how to check whether its prime or not - 
	
	if a number is divisible by only that number and 1 without a remainder, that number is a prime number.
	
	if we consider the integers less than the square root of the number, then if the number is only divisible by 1, that is a prime (expect 1).
